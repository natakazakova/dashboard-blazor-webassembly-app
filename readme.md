# Get Started - Dashboard Component in Blazor WebAssembly Application

This project demonstrates how you can incorporate a DevExpress Dashboard component into a [Blazor WebAssembly](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-5.0) application. Use it as a template when you need to create a similar web application.

The backend `Server` app is an ASP.NET Core application that process requests from the client. A hosted Blazor WebAssembly `Client` app defines the UI for this component and the logic needed to respond to UI updates.
